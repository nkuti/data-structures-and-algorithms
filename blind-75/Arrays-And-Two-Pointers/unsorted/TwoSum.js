/** Problem description:
 *
 *Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
    return the indices i and j such that 
    nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

    You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

    Return the answer with the smaller index first.
